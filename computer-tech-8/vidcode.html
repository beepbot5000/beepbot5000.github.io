<h3>Concepts Learned</h3>
<p>
I did not learn any new "concepts" because I am already familiar with programming. People who are not already
familiar with programming would probably still have trouble anwsering this question because these "learning"
"programs" (In quotes because Scratch and Vidcode are "web apps" and thus not real programs.) don't teach anything.
They might teach a kid what a varible is but that's the most basic thing ever and they probably already know
what a varible is in ""coding"". Sure Vidcode teaches javascript varibles and syntax but that's what you would
teach first if you were actually trying to teach javascript anyway. All it does is teach how to use their 
pre-made functions to put text on their pre-made screen window in their pre-made web app. You don't need to buy
a subscription to a web app that teaches nothing but how to use their own functions, syntax and varibles and none
of the real world useful uses of javascript. Just have them open up notepad and type javascript!
</p>

<h3>What I Created</h3>
<p>
I made a "filter" that makes whatever image you replace the filename with in their image-displaying-in-their-project-screen-window
function look like it's on an old TV. Of course though we did that inside of Vidcode with the pre-made functions because writing
real javascript from scratch in notepad where you can upload an image then it displays an image with effects you programmed yourself
would be to hard for the almost 14 year olds! They can't understand that! They're  not advanced enough for ""text-based"" ""coding""!
</p>

<h3>What Worked Well</h3>
<p>
Vidcode's pre-made functions worked well to make the ""coding"" as simple as Scratch.
</p>

<h3>What I Would Do Differently Next Time</h3>
<p>
I used a frame of an old Doctor Who episode which was already in black in white so next time I wouldn't use a black and white picture to use
with my black and white "filter"
