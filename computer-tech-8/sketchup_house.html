	SketchUp is a program for 3D modeling and can be used for a varity of purposes such as 
	architectural, interior design, industrial and product design, landscape architecture, 
	civil and mechanical engineering, theater, film and video game development.
	</p>

	<p>
	We disigned a house in SketchUp. We started with the floor plan by making a platform, offsetting it 6 inches in for walls, and
	then extruding them up 10 inches. To make more rooms we would extrude the base platform floor out and then offset it for the
	walls.
	</p>

	<p>
	After we finished our floor plan we added furniture from the "3D Warehouse" where you can find user-created models to use.

	This was my house's inside before I added a roof:

	On the outside I added a roof and added materials. The roof looks kinda silly because of how it has 2 peaks but the peaks aren't pyramids.

	I didn't have anytime to add a surrounding porperty sadly. If I did, it surely would've made my project even slower than it was because it was 23 megabytes by 
	the end because of big models I put in.
