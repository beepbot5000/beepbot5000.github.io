<h1>Bryce 3D Abstract Art</h1>

<p><b>Due Date: Apr 14, 2022 | Submitted: Apr 14, 2022 | Grade: 95%</b></p>

<p>Bryce is a program for making 3D scenes. It provides lots of premade models to put into your scene. We made a 3D scene in Bryce the week before of whatever we wanted. The next week we had to make an abstract scene, I struggled to think of what to make because I don't like abstract things, but I came up whatever this is. I was hoping there would be a "forest" model so I wouldn't have to place a ton of trees inside the circle but there wasn't so I took about 20 minutes to place trees but then I rendered it and it was taking a long time so I got rid of most of the trees and left only 2.</p>
