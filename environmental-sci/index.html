<h1>Environmental Science</h1>
<p>
Enviromental Science is a high school level class that you can take in 8th instead of normal science
and get a high school credit.

I've been really enjoying the class. The topics are intriguing to me; The first unit was on Atoms\The
Periodic Table and I liked figuring out the number of subatomic particles for ions and isotopes and also
drawing the atoms. Second unit was on Renewable Energy and Climate Change related stuff, and I was wondering
about that around that time so I liked learning about it. The amount of work we have is about prefect for me;
I never have to do anything at home because I didn't finish it in class and I never sit around, bored 
because I finished my work. Mrs Sooter, our teacher, is also very nice.
