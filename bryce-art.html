<h1>Bryce 3D Art</h1>

<p>Bryce is a program for making 3D scenes. It provides lots of premade models to put into your scene, like trees, basic 3D shapes, and a vitruvian man for some reason and it's flat like a cardboard cut-out. I used vitruvian men to make an invasion using the star wars ships and buildings.</p>
