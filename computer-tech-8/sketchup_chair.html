	SketchUp is a program for 3D modeling and can be used for a varity of purposes such as 
	architectural, interior design, industrial and product design, landscape architecture, civil and 
	mechanical engineering, theater, film and video game development.
	</p>

	<h2>Chair Modeling</h2>
	<p>
	In SketchUp we made a 3D chair following a video then we all transformed our chair model into
	anything we wanted aslong as it kept the seat of the chair.
	</p>

	<p>All of our chairs started like this:</p>

	<p>
	I made my chair into the tardis from Doctor Who because it's just a box so I extruded the seat
	out on each side and extruded the sides up to make walls and a roof.
