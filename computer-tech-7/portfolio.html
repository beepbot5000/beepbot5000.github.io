<h1>Portfolio Website</h1>

<p><b>Due Date: Nov 30th, 2022 | Submitted: Sep 8th, 2022 | Grade: 80% </b></p>

<p>
At the begginning of the trimester we all had to make a portfolio of all the assignments we were going to do that year and update it throughout the trimester. Miss Clark used Google Sites and showed us how to make a website in Google Sites, but I didn't want to use Google Sites because I felt it was limited and I wanted my website to be unique, also I felt that Google Sites was "normie". Just learn html, it's not that hard. I coded a site in html and css and hosted it with Github Pages.
</p>

<p>
My website looked awful and my scope got out of hand. I kept changing how the assignments were displayed. Instead of having a page for each assignment like this, I made little rectangles with a short description and an image, which limited me in what I could do, for example; I couldn't add multiple images like I have on this page. 
</p>

<img src="files/old-portfolio.png" width="400px" alt"Old Portfolio" title="Old Portfolio"> <br>
<img src="files/old-portfolio-redesign.png" height="250px" alt="Old Portfolio Redesign" title="Old Portfolio Redesign">

<p>
This is what the first page looked like when I submitted it, after a couple days I saw that Miss Clark hadn't graded it yet so I decided redesign it (image on the right). I changed how the assingments were display and made a top bar that stayed if you scrolled, but I didn't add all of the assingments. I got a 80% even though there was only 1 assignment that I put on it and the page for it was the wrong assignment because I was using it as a placeholder. Probably pity points because I made <b>something</b> in html and I was only 12.
</p>

<p>
This website was made because I was bored so I decided to remake my portfolio for Computer Tech because the original was awful. I started it on May 31th 2023 and it is June 1st 2023 as of writing
