<h1>SketchUp Dog House</h1>

<p>
 SketchUp is a program for 3D modeling and can be used for a varity of purposes such as architectural, interior design, industrial and product design, landscape architecture, civil and mechanical engineering, theater, film and video game development. 
</p>

<h2>Dog House</h2>
<p>
In SketchUp we made dog houses following a video tutorial and then added onto it. 
</p>

<p>
After we made the dog house we were instructed to find a dog in the "3D Warehouse" where you can find user created models to add to your project. I found a funny looking dog that was sitting down on it's legs like a toddler and holding up a concrete circle like it was using it as a weight so I put a scaled up fishing weight on it. I made a shelf for weights beside the dog house aswell.
