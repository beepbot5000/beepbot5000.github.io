<h1>Pop Art</h1>

<p>For our last assignment we made "Pop Art" (art without line-art basically) in Google Drawings, presumably to teach us how to use Google Drawings. We took an image and put shapes over it to make it pop art. I chose to make a Digimon Vital Bracelet because I had one and I like Digimon.</p>
